## How to Get the Best Sound from Native Instruments Scarbee Pre-Bass?
 
There are many ways to get the best sound from Native Instruments Scarbee Pre-Bass, depending on your personal preference and musical context. Here are some general tips and tricks that you can try:
 
- Use the right articulation for the right situation. For example, use mutes for funky grooves, harmonics for ambient sounds, hammer-ons and pull-offs for smooth legato lines, etc. You can switch between articulations using key switches or MIDI CCs[^1^].
- Use the right velocity for the right expression. For example, use higher velocities for louder and brighter sounds, lower velocities for softer and darker sounds. You can also use MIDI CCs to control the volume and tone of each string[^1^].
- Use the right effect preset for the right vibe. For example, use Fat for a round and tight bass sound, Heavy for an edgy and hard bass sound, Crunchy for a powerful and mildly distorted bass sound, Pop for a fat and crispy bass sound[^2^]. You can also tweak the effect parameters to suit your taste[^1^].
- Use EQ and compression to shape the sound further. For example, use EQ to boost or cut certain frequencies to make the bass stand out or blend in with other instruments. Use compression to control the dynamics and add punch or warmth to the bass sound.
- Use automation to add variation and movement to the sound. For example, use automation to change the articulation, velocity, volume, tone or effect of the bass during different parts of the song. This can make the bass sound more realistic and expressive.
