## What's New in Adobe InDesign CC 2018?
 
Adobe InDesign CC 2018 has many new features and enhancements that make it easier and faster to create professional-looking layouts and pages. Here are some of the highlights:
 
- **Layout adjustment:** You can now change the page size, margin, or bleed of a document without manually adjusting the text, images, or other elements. The new Adjust Layout feature automatically adapts all elements in the layout to the new settings. This saves you time and effort when you need to resize or reformat your documents.
- **Import PDF comments:** You can now import any marked up PDF into InDesign and easily track the feedback and comments noted in the PDF. You can accept comments and mark them resolved or unresolved. Selecting a comment also highlights the section in the document where the comment is applicable. This makes it easier to collaborate with clients and reviewers and incorporate their suggestions into your design.
- **Properties panel:** The new Properties panel in InDesign lets you view settings and controls in the context of your current task or workflow. This new panel has been designed with ease of use in mind, ensuring that you have access to the right controls when you need them. The Properties panel is available by default in the Essentials workspace. You can also enable it from Window > Properties.
- **Visual font browsing:** You can now browse thousands of fonts from hundreds of type foundries from within InDesign, activate them instantly, and use them in your documents. The Fonts panel includes various new options to provide you an enriched experience while working with fonts. You can apply a filter to view only the recently added fonts. You can also select a sample text from the list of predefined text for font preview or select your own text as well. You now also have the option to change the font size while previewing the font.
- **OpenType SVG fonts support:** With the support for OpenType SVG fonts in InDesign, you can now provide multiple colors and gradients in a single glyph. You can also use OpenType SVG emoji fonts to include colorful and graphical characters, such as smileys, flags, street signs, animals, people, food, and landmarks in your documents. You can also create composite glyphs by combining single-person characters with diverse skin tones.
