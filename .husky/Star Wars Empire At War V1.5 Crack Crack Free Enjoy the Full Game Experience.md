The film begins with Gajendra (Vijayakanth) saving a young girl Anjali (Flora) from a group of thugs who try to kidnap her. He takes her to his home and treats her as his sister. He also works as a bodyguard for a rich businessman (Rajeev). Anjali is the daughter of Rajeev's friend who died in an accident. Rajeev wants to adopt Anjali and make her his heir, but he faces opposition from his relatives who want to kill her and take over his wealth. Gajendra vows to protect Anjali from any harm.
  
Meanwhile, Gajendra falls in love with Indu (Laya), a college student who lives in his neighborhood. Indu is initially annoyed by Gajendra's antics, but soon reciprocates his feelings. However, Indu's father (Rajan P. Dev) is against their relationship and tries to separate them. He also hires a goon named Bheem Singh (Mukesh Rishi) to kill Gajendra. Bheem Singh has a personal grudge against Gajendra, as he was the one who killed his brother in the past.
  
The film takes a twist when it is revealed that Anjali is not Rajeev's friend's daughter, but the daughter of a dreaded don named Narasimha (Prakash Raj). Narasimha had killed Rajeev's friend and kidnapped Anjali when she was a baby. He wanted to use her as a pawn to blackmail Rajeev and take over his business. However, Anjali escaped from his clutches and ended up with Gajendra. Narasimha sends his men to retrieve Anjali and kill Gajendra. Gajendra fights back and decides to confront Narasimha once and for all.
  
Gajendra reaches Narasimha's hideout and confronts him. He reveals that he is the son of Narasimha's former partner who was betrayed and killed by him. He also reveals that he was the one who rescued Anjali from Narasimha's men when she was a baby and raised her as his sister. He challenges Narasimha to a fight and defeats him. He then reunites Anjali with Rajeev and tells him the truth about her identity. Rajeev is grateful to Gajendra and accepts him as his son-in-law.
  
However, Bheem Singh arrives at the scene and shoots Gajendra in the chest. He then tries to kill Anjali and Indu, but Gajendra gets up and kills him with his last breath. He then collapses and dies in Indu's arms. Anjali and Indu cry over his dead body and mourn his loss. The film ends with a montage of Gajendra's memories with them.
