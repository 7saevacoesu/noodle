The ABNT NBR 15849 standard is based on the concept that small sanitary landfills are components designed to minimize the environmental impacts of urban solid waste disposal. The standard defines small sanitary landfills as those that dispose of around 20 tons of waste per day. The standard also provides guidelines for the selection of suitable sites, the design of the landfill cells and leachate collection systems, the operation and maintenance procedures, and the closure and post-closure plans.
 
The ABNT NBR 15849 standard is aligned with the National Policy on Solid Waste (PNRS), which was established by Law No. 12,305/2010. The PNRS aims to promote the integrated management of solid waste in Brazil, based on the principles of prevention, reduction, reuse, recycling, treatment and environmentally adequate disposal. The PNRS also establishes the shared responsibility of generators, transporters, managers and public authorities for the proper handling of solid waste.
 
The ABNT NBR 15849 standard is one of the technical tools that can help municipalities to comply with the PNRS and to improve their environmental performance. By following the standard, municipalities can reduce the risks of soil and water contamination, greenhouse gas emissions, fire outbreaks, odors, pests and diseases associated with improper waste disposal. Moreover, municipalities can also optimize their financial resources and enhance their social responsibility by implementing small sanitary landfills.
