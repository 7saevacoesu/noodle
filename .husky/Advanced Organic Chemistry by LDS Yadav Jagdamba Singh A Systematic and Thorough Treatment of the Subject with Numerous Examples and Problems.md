# Advanced Organic Chemistry by LDS Yadav Jagdamba Singh: A Comprehensive Guide for IIT-JEE Aspirants
 
Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, and reactions of organic compounds, which contain carbon in covalent bonding. Organic chemistry is a vast and diverse field that encompasses many aspects of life sciences, such as biochemistry, pharmacology, and biotechnology. Organic chemistry is also essential for understanding the synthesis and design of new materials, such as polymers, drugs, and nanomaterials.
 
Advanced Organic Chemistry by LDS Yadav Jagdamba Singh is a book that covers the advanced topics of organic chemistry for students preparing for the IIT-JEE examination. The book is divided into two parts: Part A deals with the structure and mechanisms of organic reactions, while Part B covers the synthesis and applications of organic compounds. The book provides a thorough and systematic treatment of the subject, with numerous examples, problems, and exercises. The book also includes the latest developments and trends in organic chemistry, such as green chemistry, organocatalysis, and click chemistry.
