Wildfire smoke is a mixture of gases and fine particles from burning vegetation, buildings, and other materials. It can cause health problems such as irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and asthma attacks. Smoke can also worsen chronic heart and lung diseases, and increase the risk of respiratory infections.

In 2019, wildfires burned millions of acres across the United States, Canada, Australia, and other parts of the world. The smoke from these fires affected millions of people, especially those living in urban areas or near the fire zones. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), one of the main components of smoke, can reduce life expectancy by several months to years.
 
So how can you protect yourself from wildfire smoke? Here are some tips from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):
 
- Check the air quality index (AQI) in your area regularly. The AQI is a measure of how polluted the air is and how it may affect your health. You can find the AQI on websites such as AirNow.gov or apps such as Smoke Sense. If the AQI is unhealthy or higher (above 150), avoid outdoor activities or reduce your physical exertion.
- Stay indoors as much as possible. Keep windows and doors closed, and use an air conditioner or a fan with a filter if you have one. Avoid using anything that burns, such as candles, fireplaces, or gas stoves. If you have a portable air cleaner, use it in the room where you spend most of your time.
- Wear a mask if you have to go outside. A mask can help reduce your exposure to smoke particles, but not all masks are effective. Choose a mask that fits snugly over your nose and mouth, and has at least two layers of fabric. Avoid masks with valves or vents, as they can let out your exhaled air and potentially spread viruses. N95 respirators are the most effective masks for filtering out smoke particles, but they are in short supply and should be reserved for health care workers and other essential workers.
- Seek medical attention if you have symptoms of smoke exposure. Some common symptoms are coughing, chest pain, difficulty breathing, wheezing, headache, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. If you have a chronic health condition such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, or diabetes, follow your doctor's advice on how to manage your condition during smoky days. If you have an emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital.

Wildfire smoke is a serious threat to public health and the environment. By following these tips, you can reduce your exposure to smoke and protect yourself and your loved ones from its harmful effects.
  
How does wildfire smoke affect the climate? Wildfire smoke can have both warming and cooling effects on the climate, depending on the type and amount of particles in the smoke. Some particles, such as black carbon, can absorb sunlight and heat up the atmosphere, while others, such as organic carbon and sulfate, can reflect sunlight and cool down the atmosphere. The net effect of wildfire smoke on the climate is uncertain and depends on many factors, such as the location, duration, and intensity of the fires, the meteorological conditions, and the interactions with clouds and other aerosols.
 
How can we prevent wildfires and reduce smoke? The best way to prevent wildfires and reduce smoke is to reduce the sources of ignition and fuel for the fires. Some of the actions that can help prevent wildfires and reduce smoke are:

- Follow local fire restrictions and regulations. Do not start campfires or burn debris in dry or windy conditions. Dispose of cigarettes and matches properly. Report any suspicious or illegal fire activity to authorities.
- Create defensible space around your home. Clear away flammable materials such as dry leaves, branches, grass, and trash from your roof, gutters, decks, and porches. Trim trees and shrubs that are close to your home or power lines. Use fire-resistant materials for your roof, siding, windows, and doors.
- Support prescribed burns and forest management. Prescribed burns are controlled fires that are intentionally set by trained professionals to reduce excess fuel and restore natural ecosystems. Forest management involves thinning dense stands of trees, removing dead or diseased trees, and restoring native vegetation. These practices can reduce the risk and severity of wildfires and smoke.

Wildfires and smoke are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, human activities, and natural factors. By taking action to prevent wildfires and reduce smoke, we can protect our health, our environment, and our future.
