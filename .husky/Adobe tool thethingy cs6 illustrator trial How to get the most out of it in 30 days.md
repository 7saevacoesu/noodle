# How to Get Adobe Illustrator CS6 for Free with Adobe Tool
 
Adobe Illustrator CS6 is a powerful vector graphics software that lets you create stunning logos, icons, illustrations, and more. But it's not cheap - a single license costs $599.99. If you want to try it out before buying, you can get a 7-day free trial from Adobe's website[^1^]. However, if you want to use it longer than that, you'll need to pay for a subscription or find another way.
 
One alternative is to use Adobe Tool, a program created by a user named TheThingy on The Pirate Bay. Adobe Tool is a patcher that can activate any Adobe product without requiring a serial number or an internet connection. It works for both Windows and Mac versions of Adobe CS6 and CC products. According to TheThingy, he stopped uploading new torrents in 2012, but he is still active on TPB and SB with Adobe Tool[^3^]. He claims that his tool can bypass Adobe's cloud-based anti-piracy measures and let you use their software for free.

However, using Adobe Tool is not legal or safe. It violates Adobe's terms of service and may expose your computer to malware or viruses. It may also damage your files or corrupt your system. Moreover, it deprives Adobe of their rightful revenue and discourages them from developing new features and updates for their products. Therefore, we do not recommend using Adobe Tool or any other pirated software. Instead, we suggest you support Adobe by purchasing a legitimate license or subscription for their products.
 
If you still want to use Adobe Tool at your own risk, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Download Adobe Illustrator CS6 from Adobe's website[^1^] and install it on your computer.
2. Download Adobe Tool from The Pirate Bay[^3^] and extract it to a folder on your desktop.
3. Run Adobe Tool as administrator and select Illustrator CS6 from the list of products.
4. Click on the Patch button and wait for the process to finish.
5. Enjoy using Illustrator CS6 for free!

Note: You may need to disable your antivirus or firewall before running Adobe Tool, as they may detect it as a threat. You may also need to block Illustrator CS6 from accessing the internet using your hosts file or firewall settings.
 
We hope this article was helpful for you. However, we strongly advise you to reconsider using Adobe Tool and instead opt for a legal and safe way of using Adobe Illustrator CS6. You can either buy a license from Adobe's website[^1^] or use one of the many free or cheaper alternatives available online. Some of them are:

- Inkscape - a free and open source vector graphics editor that can import and export AI files.
- Affinity Designer - a professional vector graphics software that costs $49.99 and offers a 10-day free trial.
- Gravit Designer - a cloud-based vector graphics tool that has a free version and a pro version that costs $49 per year.
