Valve Hammer Editor is not only a map editor, but also a level design tool. You can use it to create realistic environments, complex puzzles, interactive objects, scripted events and more. You can also test your maps in-game and see how they look and play.
 
One of the most important features of Valve Hammer Editor is the ability to create brushes. Brushes are solid geometric shapes that define the boundaries of your map. You can manipulate brushes in various ways, such as scaling, rotating, shearing, clipping and carving. You can also apply different textures to the faces of brushes to give them different appearances.
 
Another feature of Valve Hammer Editor is the ability to create entities. Entities are objects that have specific functions and properties in your map. For example, a light entity can emit light, a trigger entity can activate something when touched, and a func\_door entity can move like a door. You can edit the properties of entities using the Object Properties window or the SmartEdit mode.
 
Valve Hammer Editor also supports advanced features such as displacements, decals, overlays, models, sounds, particles and more. You can use these features to add more detail and realism to your maps. You can also use custom assets from other sources or create your own using tools such as VTFEdit, GIMP or Blender.
