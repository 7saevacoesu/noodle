The update also adds a new scenario called "The Rich Explorer", which challenges the player to start with a single colonist who has a lot of money and advanced equipment, but no allies or resources. The scenario is designed to be more difficult than the default "Crashlanded" scenario, as the player will have to deal with hostile factions, harsh weather, and scarce resources on their own.
 
RimWorld V1.0.1962 is the last update for version 1.0 of the game, which was officially released on October 17, 2018, after five years of development and testing. Version 1.0 marked the end of the beta phase of RimWorld, and it was widely praised by critics and players alike for its depth, replayability, moddability, and storytelling potential. The game has sold over one million copies as of July 2019[^2^], and it has a very positive rating on Steam based on over 70,000 reviews.
