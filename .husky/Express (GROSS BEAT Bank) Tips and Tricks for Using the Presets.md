## What is Gross Beat?
 
Gross Beat is a time and volume manipulation effect plugin that can create real-time or rendered gating, glitch, repeat, scratching, and stutter effects. It can also be used for sidechain compression, ducking, and tremolo effects. Gross Beat has two main sections: a 36-slot time engine and a 36-slot volume engine. Each slot can be assigned a different preset or pattern that can be triggered by MIDI or automation. Gross Beat can sync to the host tempo or run freely with its own independent speed and resolution settings.
