## What are the Alternatives to RatioMaster-1.8.9?
 
If you are looking for other ways to cheat your ratio on BitTorrent trackers, you may want to consider some alternatives to RatioMaster-1.8.9. Here are some of them:
 
### mRatio
 
mRatio is a newer and updated version of RatioMaster that works on most trackers. It has a similar interface and functionality as RatioMaster-1.8.9, but it also supports more BitTorrent clients and protocols. It can also use proxy servers and VPNs to hide your IP address from the tracker[^3^].
 
### uTorrent Leecher Edition
 
uTorrent Leecher Edition is a modified version of uTorrent that can fake your upload stats by reversing the download and upload values. It is based on uTorrent 1.8.3 and it works on some private trackers that do not check for client versions or hashes. However, it may be easily detected by more advanced trackers and it may cause problems with your real downloads.
 
### AutoDL-IRSSI
 
AutoDL-IRSSI is a plugin for rutorrent that can automatically download new torrents from private trackers as soon as they are released. This way, you can get a lot of upload credit by seeding to other peers who download after you. You can also filter the torrents by categories, keywords, sizes, freeleech status, etc. However, this method requires a fast internet connection and a seedbox to avoid filling up your hard drive.
 
## Which Method Should You Choose?
 
The best method to cheat your ratio on BitTorrent trackers depends on your preferences, needs, and risks. If you want a simple and easy way to fake your stats without downloading or uploading anything, you can use RatioMaster-1.8.9 or mRatio. If you want to use a modified torrent client that can reverse your upload and download values, you can use uTorrent Leecher Edition. If you want to use a plugin that can automatically download new torrents and seed them to other peers, you can use AutoDL-IRSSI.
  
However, you should be aware that none of these methods are 100% safe or guaranteed to work on all trackers. Some trackers may have anti-cheat measures that can detect and ban fake uploaders or leechers. Therefore, you should always check the rules and policies of the trackers you are using before using any of these methods.
