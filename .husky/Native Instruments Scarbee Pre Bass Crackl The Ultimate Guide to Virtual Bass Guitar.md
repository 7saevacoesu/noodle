## What is Native Instruments Scarbee Pre Bass Crackl?
 
Native Instruments Scarbee Pre Bass Crackl is a KONTAKT instrument that runs in the free KONTAKT PLAYER or in KONTAKT. It is based on the renowned Scarbee Blue Bass, which was created by accomplished bassist and producer Thomas Hansen Skarbye. He recorded his own Fender Precision bass with round-wound strings to get a fat and dirty sound that suits pop, rock, hip-hop, R&B and more.
 
The instrument features over 4,000 samples covering all four strings and nine velocity layers. It also has a vast and intuitive set of playing techniques, such as mutes, harmonics, hammer-ons, pull-offs, grace notes and more. You can access these articulations without key switches, as they are dynamically updated on the fretboard display as you play. This makes for a highly authentic and fun playing experience.
 
Additionally, the instrument comes with four different amp setups: Fat, Heavy, Crunchy and Pop. These are production-ready sounds that have been recorded through various amplifiers for different sonic flavors. You can switch between them easily and tweak them further with the built-in EQ and effects presets.
 
## How to Get the Best Sound from Native Instruments Scarbee Pre Bass Crackl?
 
To get the best sound from Native Instruments Scarbee Pre Bass Crackl, you need to pay attention to some important aspects, such as tuning, velocity, expression and mixing. Here are some tips to help you out:
 
- Tune your instrument before playing. You can use the built-in tuner or any external tuner of your choice. Make sure your instrument is in tune with the rest of your track.
- Adjust the velocity curve to match your playing style and MIDI controller. You can use the velocity curve editor in the instrument interface to fine-tune the response of the instrument to your MIDI input. You can also use the velocity randomizer to add some human variation to your playing.
- Use the expression pedal or mod wheel to control the volume of the instrument. This will allow you to create dynamic changes in your performance and add some realism and emotion to your bass lines.

- Choose the right amp setup for your genre and style. You can switch between Fat, Heavy, Crunchy and Pop with a single click or MIDI CC message. You can also adjust the tone and level of each amp setup with the knobs on the interface.
- Use the EQ and effects presets to shape your sound further. You can access them from the drop-down menu on the interface or assign them to MIDI CC messages. You can also tweak them with the knobs on the interface or create your own presets.
- Mix your bass track with the rest of your instruments. You can use compression, EQ, saturation and other effects to make your bass sit well in the mix. You can also use sidechain compression or ducking to make your bass groove with your drums.
