## How to Use the Drinking Mod
  
Once you have installed the mod, you can start using it in your game. There are several ways to get drinks for your Sims:
  
- You can buy them from a restaurant, a bar, or a San Mishuno stall.
- You can order them from the delivery service if you have the RealCook Mod by icemunmun.
- You can make them yourself from the cookbook or the refrigerator menu if you have the Cookbook S&S by Simmerina.
- You can buy them from any lot retail if you have the Savvier Seller Mod by ani\_.

There are many types of drinks available in the mod, such as beer, wine, whiskey, vodka, cognac, and more. Each drink has its own buff and mood effect on your Sim. For example, beer will make your Sim relaxed and happy, while whiskey will make them confident and flirty. Some drinks are compatible with the Basemental Mod by basementalcc, which means they will also give your Sim an intoxication effect that can impair their judgment and actions.
