However, some questions may take longer than others, depending on their difficulty level and complexity. Therefore, you need to manage your time wisely and prioritize the questions that you can answer quickly and confidently. Don't spend too much time on one question or get stuck on a difficult one. You can always skip a question and come back to it later if you have time left.

Remember that this test is not only a measure of your intelligence but also a fun and stimulating challenge that can improve your cognitive skills.
